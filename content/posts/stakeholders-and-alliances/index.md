# Stakeholders and Alliances

I had just started my second job as a manager of a software programme developing several mobile applications and supporting data analytics software. I had an interview with  the very senior leader of the company before officially getting the position.  I was being vetted because this was a senior engineering manager position and carried a fair amount of responsibilities with it. If successful I would oversee and be accountable for delivery of the whole technical estate including the consumer facing software, supporting IT systems and backend LOB software. I felt like this was a lot of responsibility and it was. And I remember being very stressed out about the interview and what it would be like. I have never been interviewed by a CXO level executive before so I had no idea what to expect. I did not even know what would be asked because it seemed like his remit was so much beyond what I was used to handling. This would be my first project of this scope - an actual bona-fide programme f work instead of a single project.

I expected fully to be stumped by the questions but strangely it turned out most of the questions were straightforward to answer. And then came the most interesting question of all. And as it turned out, the one that actually did stump me and was one thing I had to improve on. He asked me - "Who are your allies in this endeavor ?". I thought for a minute and replied back with a full list of everyone on our senior team - a group of about 5 members, a PM, a business manager, a product manager and an operations manager. As it turn out, that was not the point of the question. As my interviewer then explained he saw a few major stakeholders who scored high for power on the stakeholder quadrant. These almost always were the biggest players in terms of who did most of the supporting IT operations.
